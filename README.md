# Smart Meeting Action Agent

## Overview
Smart Meeting Action Agent is an AI-powered assistant built using Elasticsearch Agent Builder.  
It converts unstructured meeting notes into structured action items with owners, due dates, and historical context.

## Problem
Meetings generate messy notes and important tasks are often missed or forgotten.  
Teams waste time searching past emails or documents to understand decisions.

## Solution

- Extract action items from meeting notes
- Identify responsible person
- Detect due dates
- Search past tasks and meetings
- Provide structured task lists with context

## Tech Stack
